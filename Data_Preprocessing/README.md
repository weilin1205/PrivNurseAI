# PrivNurse Data Preprocessing

## âœ¨ Abstract
The preprocessing stage implements comprehensive data cleaning and standardization procedures:

* **Data Cleaning**: Removal of incomplete records to ensure data integrity and prevent downstream processing errors.
* **Data Integration**: Consolidation of multi-source medical records from different hospital departments and systems, ensuring temporal consistency and data completeness
* **Standardization**: Implementation of uniform formatting across different record types, including consistent date formats, medication dosing notation, and laboratory value representations
* **Structure Information**: Extraction and organization of key clinical data points using natural language processing techniques specifically designed for medical text
* **Data De-identification**: Removal of all personally identifiable information (PII), such as patient names, identification numbers, and contact details, to ensure data is fully de-identified and compliant with privacy regulations.
